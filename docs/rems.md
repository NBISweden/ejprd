REMS is deployed at rems.ejprd.nbis.se.

The application runs from `~/starter-kit-rems` at the demo server (134.158.151.84).

The code is directly cloned from the [starter kit repo](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/starter-kit-rems).

To use REMS (adding resources and granting access etc), either go to the [GUI](https://rems.ejprd.nbis.se) (instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/CSCfi/rems/blob/master/manual/owner.md#how-to-add-resources-to-rems)),
or use [the api](https://rems.ejprd.nbis.se/swagger-ui/index.html).

To add users, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/GenomicDataInfrastructure/starter-kit-rems?tab=readme-ov-file#create-a-robot-user-and-an-api-key), replacing the user identity with the actual user.
